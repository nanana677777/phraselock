# Changelog

All notable changes to PhraseLock are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **"What's new?" window.** After an update, the next time you open Settings a window lists what changed since the version you last saw (read from `CHANGELOG.md`, now bundled in the .exe) and remembers it. A fresh install does not see it. *Settings > Home > What's new?* opens it any time. New `version.py` (bump it when you release; "[Unreleased]" entries are shown under that version), `whatsnew.py` and setting `last_seen_version`.
- **Window title follows the style, and you can make your own packs.** The Settings header now reads `app_kicker` / `app_title` from the active pack (TechDom: "TECHDOM / DISCIPLINE PROTOCOL", PetDom: "PETDOM / GOOD PET PROTOCOL", no pack: "PHRASELOCK / DISCIPLINE PROTOCOL"). Packs in `%APPDATA%\PhraseLock\packs\<name>\pack.json` are now listed and applied like the shipped ones, and *Settings > Look > Save my settings as a pack...* creates one from your current settings (phrase, sound and background files are copied in; no password or schedule is ever copied).
- **First-launch setup wizard.** The first time PhraseLock is opened (no config file yet) a five-step wizard asks for a style (theme pack or default look), a difficulty, how strict to be (keep the style's rules, gentle, standard or strict), an optional emergency password (and, with it, the style's protections) and whether to start protecting right away. Your answers win over the pack's defaults. It can be skipped, and run again from *Settings > Home*. New modules/settings: `wizard.py`, `setup_done`, `advanced_view`.
- **Simple Home tab.** Settings now opens on a **Home** tab with the essentials (style, difficulty, emergency password). Users who went through the wizard see only that tab until they tick *Show advanced settings*, which brings back Phrases, Look, Rules, Protection and Stats. Existing installs keep every tab.
- **Theme editor.** *Settings > Look > Theme editor* lets you create, rename, duplicate and delete your own colour themes (main, secondary and third accent, with a colour picker). They show up in the Theme list and are used by the lock screen and the focus-session window. Built-in themes are read-only but can be duplicated; deleting the theme in use falls back to Cyber Red. New setting `custom_themes`, validated on backup import.
- **PetDom theme pack.** Juno, a warm but firm handler: amber `PetDom` theme, 28 friendly "good pet" phrases, lock-screen wording, three original backgrounds (paw trail, bokeh, toys), generated chirp/boop sounds and gentler rules (a typo does not reset progress, 20 s time out). Protections stay opt-in.
- **Theme packs, first pack: TechDom.** *Settings > Look > Theme pack* applies a whole preset in
  one click: a phrase file, theme and colours, background images and GIFs, success/error sounds,
  lock-screen wording and challenge rules (rounds, paste, delay, attempts, lockout). TechDom is a
  calm systems administrator called Vex: cyan terminal look, 28 phrases (easy to extreme),
  access-control texts, three original background images (grid, circuit, data stream) and generated `.wav` sounds, so the pack works as soon as it is applied. A pack lives in `packs/<name>/` and its files are
  copied to `%APPDATA%\PhraseLock\packs\<name>\` (*Open pack folder* opens it), where your own
  images, GIFs and sounds are never overwritten.
- Packs only change an allow-list of settings: never the emergency password, auto-protection or
  the schedule. Protections (strict mode, idle lock) are opt-in and refused without an emergency
  password. *Undo last pack* puts the previous values back. Applying the same pack again (for new images, say) keeps the way back to your original settings.
- New `TechDom` theme, new setting `ui_texts` (lock-screen wording, empty = built-in texts), new
  modules `themes.py` (one colour table now shared by the lock screen, the focus window and the
  Settings window) and `packs.py`, and unit tests (`tests/test_packs.py`). Imported backups have their lock-screen texts and background list validated, and a missing pack file now tells you to apply the pack again. The `packs` folder is
  bundled into `PhraseLock.exe`.
- **Pause without the challenge.** Right-click the tray icon > *Pause PhraseLock* (5 minutes,
  15 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour) and *Resume now*. While paused nothing locks: not after a
  Windows lock or unlock, not by the idle lock, and a lock screen that is already showing
  closes within a second. The tray icon gets a blue badge and says how many minutes are left.
  The pause is stored in its own `pause.json` (so it survives a restart of the monitor, and
  pausing never rebuilds the lock screen). It lasts 24 hours at most, whatever the clock says.
- **Pause hotkey.** New *Pause / panic* section in the *Protection* tab: a global hotkey
  (for example `Ctrl+Alt+P`, off by default) that pauses for a chosen number of minutes, and
  pressed again resumes. It also works while the lock screen is showing. If another program
  already uses the combination, the problem is written to `phraselock.log`.
- New settings `pause_hotkey` and `pause_minutes`, new modules `hotkeys.py`, and unit tests
  (`tests/test_pause.py`).
- **Animated GIF backgrounds.** A `.gif` in the background list (local file or direct
  URL) now plays on the lock screen instead of showing only its first frame, on the main
  screen (behind the phrase panel) and on every extra locked screen. Frame timing follows
  the GIF; the animation only runs while the lock is showing, so the hidden standby
  overlay costs no CPU. Transparent pixels show the dark background colour.
- New setting `animate_gif_backgrounds` (checkbox *Play animated GIF backgrounds* in the
  *Look* tab, on by default). Off = first frame only, like before.
- Several screens stay in step: one clock drives every screen that shows the same GIF, frames are skipped (never queued) when drawing is slower than the GIF, and same-size screens share the work. A note in `phraselock.log` says when the PC is too slow for the GIF.
- Very large GIFs are shrunk and/or cut (max 240 frames, about 96 MB decoded per GIF) so
  they cannot use up the memory; a GIF that does not fit is shown as a still picture.
- New module `gifbg.py` with unit tests (`tests/test_gifbg.py`).
- **Image display mode per screen.** Next to each monitor in the *Look* tab, an *Image
  mode* menu sets how the background fits that screen (Default, Fill, Fit, Stretch,
  Center, Tile). *Default* uses the global *Image display mode*.
- **Different picture on each screen.** New option *Show a different random picture on
  each screen*. Each locked screen gets its own random image when there are enough
  images (otherwise some are reused); when it is off, all screens show the same picture
  as before.
- New settings `screen_background_modes` and `background_per_screen`, with unit tests.
- **Several background images.** The *Look* tab now has a list of background images
  (*Add files...*, *Add URL...*, *Remove selected*, *Clear all*). One image is picked at
  random each time the lock appears, and never the same one twice in a row. Images that
  cannot be loaded are skipped. All locked screens show the same picture.
- New `background_images` setting. The older single `background_image` value is still
  used when the new key is missing, so existing configs keep working.
- Unit tests for the background list and the random pick (`tests/test_media.py`).
- **Multi-screen support.** The *Look* tab has a new "Show the lock on" section: tick
  one, several or all monitors ("All screens" also covers monitors plugged in later).
  The phrase panel appears on the primary screen (or on the left-most ticked screen if
  the primary is not ticked); the other ticked screens show the background image with
  no panel. Preview closes if you click a cover screen.
- New `lock_screens` setting (`"primary"` by default, so existing installs behave as
  before). The older single-value `lock_screen` key is still understood.
- New `monitors.py` module (monitor detection and selection) with unit tests.

### Fixed
- With a success sound enabled, the extra screens of a multi-screen lock are now hidden
  at the same moment as the main one instead of staying covered until the sound ends.

### Changed
- If a ticked monitor is unplugged it is skipped, and the primary screen is used when
  none of the ticked monitors is left. The saved choice is kept.
- The hidden standby lock rebuilds itself when the monitor layout changes.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-18

### Added
- `LICENSE` (MIT).
- `CHANGELOG.md` with the history of each version.
- Pinned `requirements.txt` (run from source) and `requirements-build.txt`
  (build the executable).
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feedback).
- Screenshots of the lock overlay and the settings window in the README.

### Changed
- The GitHub Actions build now installs the pinned requirements and uses the same
  PyInstaller options as `bat.bat`: it bundles `pystray`, the tray modules and the
  application icons, so executables built by the workflow include the system tray
  icon and the window icon.
- `bat.bat` installs `requirements-build.txt`.
- README updated (license, running from source, project structure, links to the
  issue templates and the changelog) and `TODO.md` updated.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-18

### Added
- **System tray icon.** PhraseLock shows its own icon in the Windows notification
  area (including the hidden icons overflow) while it is running. A small badge
  shows the state: no badge when active, yellow when outside the schedule, grey
  when disabled.
- **Tray menu.** Double-click the icon (or right-click, *Open settings*) to open
  the settings window.
- **Application icon.** The settings window and its dialogs use the PhraseLock
  icon instead of the default Tk feather.
- **Automatic save.** Settings are saved at every change, not only when clicking
  the Save button.
- **Background image scaling.** Display options for the lock background image
  (fit, fill, stretch, center, tile).

### Fixed
- The success sound did not play correctly when completing the lock challenge.
- A bug when opening several previews at once.
- Opening the settings from the tray created duplicate windows. If the settings
  are already open, nothing new is launched and a notification is shown.
- *"Failed to start embedded python interpreter!"* when opening the settings from
  the tray icon.
- *"Failed to remove temporary directory"* warning when closing the app: every
  relaunched PhraseLock process now extracts its own temporary folder.

### Changed
- Logging cleanup.
- Added a `TODO.md` roadmap, new modules `tray.py` and `appicon.py`; `bat.bat`
  installs `pystray` and bundles `icon.ico` / `icon.png` into the executable.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added
- First public release: customizable typing challenge on Windows unlock, phrase
  libraries (TXT, CSV, JSON), themes and visual customization, progress tracking
  (streaks, daily goals, XP, levels, badges), emergency recovery password and a
  Windows executable.
