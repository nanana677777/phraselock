# 🔒 PhraseLock

**Turn unlocking your Windows PC into a customizable typing challenge.**

PhraseLock is a Windows application that asks you to type configured phrases as part of a personal discipline, focus, or self-imposed challenge routine.

Customize your phrases, choose a visual theme, track your progress, and make each unlock challenge your own.

> **⚠️ Important:** PhraseLock is a personal challenge tool, not a security product. It is not designed to protect sensitive files or replace Windows security. Test it carefully before enabling any automatic protection.

## ✨ Features

- **Custom typing challenges** — use your own phrases and challenge styles.
- **Theme packs** — one click in *Settings > Look* applies phrases, theme, backgrounds, sounds, interface texts and challenge rules together. The first pack is **TechDom** (a calm sysadmin called Vex); the last pack can be undone, and a pack never touches your emergency password.
- **Customizable settings** — configure the experience to suit your preferences.
- **Progress tracking** — features in the source include streaks, daily goals, XP, levels, and badges.
- **Phrase libraries** — support for external TXT, CSV, and JSON phrase collections.
- **Visual customization** — themes, backgrounds (including animated GIFs), interface scaling, and visual effects are available in the project.
- **Several background images** — add as many pictures as you like; one is picked at random each time the lock appears, optionally a different one on each screen.
- **Multi-screen support** — lock the primary screen, any screen, several screens, or all of them.
- **Emergency recovery** — configure an emergency password before using protection features.
- **Pause** — pause PhraseLock for 5 minutes to 1 hour from the tray icon, or with an optional global hotkey, without typing the phrase.
- **System tray icon** — see at a glance that PhraseLock is running; open the settings from the tray.
- **Windows executable** — get started without manually running the Python source code.

Feature availability may depend on the version and configuration you are running.

## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Download the release

1. Open the [PhraseLock Releases page](https://github.com/nanana677777/phraselock/releases).
2. Select the latest release (see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed).
3. Download `PhraseLock.exe` from the release assets.
4. Save it somewhere convenient, such as a dedicated `PhraseLock` folder.
5. Run the executable and configure your preferences.

**Tip:** Keep a copy of your downloaded executable in a safe location so you can recover or reinstall it if needed.

### Windows SmartScreen warning

Windows may display a warning when launching an executable that is not code-signed. This warning does not, by itself, prove that a file is malicious or safe.

Only run the executable if you trust its source. You can also inspect the source code or build the project yourself before running it.

## ⚙️ Getting started

1. Launch PhraseLock.
2. Open the settings interface and configure your phrases.
3. Set an emergency password and verify that your recovery method works.
4. If you use several monitors, pick which ones show the lock in the **Look** tab (see the Multi-screen section below).
5. Review the available protection and challenge settings.
6. Test the challenge manually before enabling automatic behavior.
7. Enable only the features you understand and want to use.

**Always test the emergency recovery procedure before enabling strict or automatic protection.** Keep an alternative way to access your Windows account available.

## 🖥️ Multi-screen

In the **Look** tab, under **Show the lock on**, tick the monitors that should be locked:

- **One screen** — only that monitor is locked; the others stay usable.
- **Several screens** — every ticked monitor is covered.
- **All screens** — every monitor is covered, including monitors you plug in later.

The phrase panel (where you type) appears on the primary screen, or on the left-most ticked screen if the primary is not ticked. The other ticked screens show the background image without the panel. The default is the primary screen only.

Backgrounds on several screens:

- **Image mode per screen** — next to each monitor, the *Image mode* menu chooses how the background fits that screen (Fill, Fit, Stretch, Center, Tile). *Default* follows the global *Image display mode*, which is handy when your monitors have different sizes or orientations.
- **Different picture per screen** — tick *Show a different random picture on each screen* (in the background images section) so every locked screen gets its own random image. With fewer images than screens, some pictures are reused. Left unticked, all screens show the same picture.

If a ticked monitor is unplugged, it is skipped; if none of the ticked monitors is available, the primary screen is used. Your choice is kept and applies again when the monitor is back.

## 📝 Custom phrase libraries

PhraseLock supports external phrase collections in TXT, CSV, and JSON formats.

The documented CSV format uses these columns:

```csv
phrase,category,difficulty
Type this phrase,General,easy
Complete your challenge,Focus,normal
```

The documented JSON format uses objects like this:

```json
[
  {
    "phrase": "Type this phrase",
    "category": "General",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  }
]
```

For TXT files, use the format expected by the phrase loader in the source code. If a file fails to load, check the examples and parsing logic in [`phrases.py`](phrases.py).

## 🛡️ Safety and recovery

**Pausing is not protected.** The tray menu and the pause hotkey (off by default) pause PhraseLock without the phrase or the emergency password. That is meant for real emergencies; if you use PhraseLock as a discipline tool, leave the hotkey empty and remember the tray menu is there.

PhraseLock can interact with Windows session locking and optional automatic protection. Misconfiguration or unexpected behavior could interrupt your normal workflow.

Before enabling protection:

- Set and test your emergency password.
- Test the application in preview mode where available.
- Keep access to your Windows account and another recovery method.
- Understand how to disable automatic protection.
- Avoid relying on PhraseLock as your only way to control access to your computer.

If PhraseLock behaves unexpectedly, use the recovery instructions in the source code and configuration documentation. Do not enable automatic restart or strict protection until you have confirmed that you can recover safely.

## 🧰 Build from source

Want to inspect the code or build your own executable?

### Requirements

- Windows
- Python 3.12 (the version used by the GitHub Actions build)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
- The pinned dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) (run from source) or [`requirements-build.txt`](requirements-build.txt) (build the executable)

### Get the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanana677777/phraselock.git
cd phraselock
```

To run from source, install the dependencies and start the app:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python phrase_lock.py
```

To build the executable, run [`bat.bat`](bat.bat) (it installs `requirements-build.txt` for you) or follow the GitHub Actions workflow in [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml).

The automated workflow runs the unit tests and builds a Windows executable.

### Run the tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Running the tests before building helps identify problems in the project's tested logic. Passing tests do not guarantee that every Windows feature works correctly on every system.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**PhraseLock does not start**

- Check whether Windows or your antivirus has blocked the executable.
- Download a fresh copy from the official [Releases page](https://github.com/nanana677777/phraselock/releases).
- If the problem persists, open a GitHub issue with your Windows version and the error message.

**My phrase library does not load**

- Check the file format and required fields.
- Compare your file with the expected format in `phrases.py`.
- Try a small test file before importing a larger collection.

**The lock does not appear on the screen I chose**

- Fully quit PhraseLock (tray icon, Task Manager) and start it again so the background process reloads the setting.
- Make sure you run a build that includes multi-screen support (rebuild the executable if you run it from `dist\`).
- Check that the monitor is listed in the **Look** tab. If it is missing, Windows does not report it; check your display settings.
- If a ticked monitor is unplugged, the primary screen is used instead.
- See `%APPDATA%\PhraseLock\phraselock.log` for "Monitor selection failed" or "Could not create a cover window" messages.

**I am worried about being locked out**

- Do not enable automatic or strict protection until recovery has been tested.
- Keep an alternative way to access your Windows account.
- If you cannot recover normally, use the project's documented recovery procedure rather than repeatedly restarting the application.
